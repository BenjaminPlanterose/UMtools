\title{Bivariate Gaussian Mixture Model}
\usage{
bGMM(
  M,
  U,
  CpG,
  K,
  stable.solution = TRUE,
  min.n = NULL,
  min.n.iter = 2000,
  method = "em.EM",
  EMC = .EMC,
  transform = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A matrix containing the methylated intensities (CpGs as rows, samples as columns)}

\item{U}{A matrix containing the unmethylated intensities (CpGs as rows, samples as columns)}

\item{CpG}{A CpG identifier (e.g. "cg15771735")}

\item{K}{Targeted number of clusters}

\item{...}{Control functions for EMCluster}
}
\value{
A vector of classes in the same order as the columns of U and M.
}
\description{
Fits a Gaussian Mixture Model (bGMM) with K components on the Unmethylated/Methylated plane
}
\details{
It employs the function init.EM from the R-package EMCluster that fits a Gaussian Mixture Model employing the expectation-maximization
algorithm on the U/M plane. Run help(init.EM) for more information on the EMCluster control functions.
